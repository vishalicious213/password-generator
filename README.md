# PASSWORD GENERATOR

This was a Scrimba project that I added on to with customizations. The original specifications called for us to build an application that generates two random passwords when the user clicks a button. Each password should be 15 characters long.

I completed that task and then added on the following:

- User can use slider to set the password length between 6-32 characters
- User can specify whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols
