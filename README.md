# PASSWORD GENERATOR

This was a Scrimba project that I added on to with customizations. The original specifications called for us to build an application that generates two random passwords when the user clicks a button. Each password should be 15 characters long.

I completed that task and then added on the following:

- User can use slider to set the password length between 6-32 characters
- User can specify whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols

## JavaScript concepts

- variables
- arrays
    - array.push
    - array.includes
    - array.pop
    - array.concat
    - array.length
- if...else statements
- for loops
- while loops
- Math.floor()
- Math.random()
- document.getElementById()
- element.addEventListener()
- element.checked
- element.textContent
